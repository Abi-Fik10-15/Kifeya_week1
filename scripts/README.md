### Technical Indicators

This project uses TA-Lib and PyNance to compute financial metrics such as:

- Moving Averages (SMA, EMA)
- RSI (Relative Strength Index)
- MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
- Volatility and returns via PyNance

These features are used for training our machine learning model for price movement prediction.
